\chapter{File Manager}

One of the things that makes KnightOS special is that it uses a proper file
system. You can organize your files into directories and subdirectories just like
you can on your computer. The KnightOS directory layout was inspired by Unix,
which will be familiar to many users. To manage this file system, you should use
the File Manager program.
